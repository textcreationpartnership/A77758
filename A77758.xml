            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The two firſt branches of the definition I ſhall put together, becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of one proves the other.</p>
               <p n="1">Firſt, <hi>Excommunication is a divine Cenſure,</hi> becauſe both the keyes were given to the Miniſtry, the key of Doctrine, and the key of Diſcipline: It is not ſaid to the Church, that they ſhall have the keyes, but ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Peter, I will give thee the keyes; Mat.</hi> 16.19. and whatſoever the Miniſtry, or Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſhall bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven, and what they looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven; Chap. 18.17, 18. and, <hi>what ſins ye remit, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and what ſins ye retaine ſhall be retained, Joh.</hi> 20.23.</p>
               <p n="2">Secondly, it is <hi>a divine Cenſure,</hi> becauſe it was inflicted only by Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, I have judged, and do not yee judge thoſe that are within: caſt out therefore that wicked perſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12 13. and ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> he that troubleth you, ſhall have his judgment, whoever he be, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.10. and he received of the Lord that which he delivered to them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. it was not done by the Miniſter alone, nor by all the Church, but it was inflicted by many, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. and this was the Elderſhip or Church-Officers, becauſe,</p>
               <p n="3">Thirdly, If this divine Cenſure be not done, the Church-Officers only are blamed for it, the Lord ſaid unto the Angell or Miniſtrie of the Church of <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyra, I have ſome thing againſt thee, becauſe thou ſuffereſt Iezabell to ſeduce my ſervants, and the Lord hath ſomthing againſt the Angell or Miniſtrie of the Church of Pergamus, becauſe they had ſome among them that hold the Doctrine of Balaam, Revel.</hi> 2.14, 20.</p>
               <p n="4">Fourthly, Excommunication is <hi>a divine Cenſure,</hi> and not a humane Ordinance, becauſe it was in the Chriſtian Church before they had either humane Lawes or Magiſtrates in it: and afterwards, when they had Kings and Einperours in the Church, they have ſubmitted themſelves to this Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="5">Fifthly, It is <hi>a divine Cenſure,</hi> becauſe the Church is commanded to obey them that have the rule over them, who alſo have ſpoken unto them the Word of God, and they watch for their ſoules, as they that muſt give an account, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7, 17. as they rule in their family, ſo they muſt rule in the Church; for both muſt obey them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 4 5.</p>
               <p>Then this is contrary to their now Modell, who utterly deny that there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch Ordinance, and would have the Magiſtrate to rule in the, Church with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall power, as they rule in the State, but this is to dethrone. Chriſt of his Kingly
<pb facs="tcp:113457:2"/>Office in the Church, who placed them to rule ſo in the State onely, and not in the Church, by the poſitive Lawes of the Land. But Miniſters rule Miniſterially by the Word only, and in obedience to Chriſt and not to men.</p>
               <p n="2">Secondly, This is contrarie to them who hold that all the Congregation muſt rule, judge and cenſure, but if all ſhould be rulers, who ſhould they rule? and if all ſhould judge and cenſure, who ſhould they judge and cenſure? it was the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Elders, thoſe Church-Officers in that Synod at Jeruſalem that made Decrees to be kept, &amp; laid it upon them, they concluded and paſſed ſentence, <hi>Acts</hi> 15 19, 28, 16, 4, 21, 25 this Cenſure of Excommunication was not infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by all, but by many; ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.45, 6.</p>
               <p n="3">Thirdly, This is contrarie to thoſe that would have this divine Cenſure to be but a humane Ordinance, and to be inflicted by the Magiſtrate ſaying <hi>tell the Church,</hi> is to tell the Magiſtrate, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17 but ſure Chriſt did never intend that brethren ſhould go to law for every ſmall private offence, but rather tell the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Church, and they would admoniſh them better: then the true meaning of Chriſt is this; There was a private offence which one neighbour had done to another, which ſhould have been decided by two ſwords, but could not; hereupon it was brought to the Elderſhip, and being a private offence they could not puniſh him that did the wrong by Excommunicating him, although he was deſperate and was neither ſorrie for what he had done, neither would make ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the wrong now the Elderſhip could onely admoniſh him privately, and if that would not reclaime him that did the wrong, from private injuries, the partie wronged was to refraine his company, and to eſteeme of him as <hi>a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then or a Publican,</hi> but neither the Church, nor other men muſt, ſo eſteem of him, till they have the ſame experience of his injurious dealing with them: for the Church doth not ſay, we will ſo eſteem of him, but <hi>let him be ſo to thee,</hi> then this could not be a civill Court of Judicatorie, for they had more power in their hands then to admoniſh him by words, although the offence was private, they might impriſon, fine, or correct him for his private offence, in regard he would be neither ſorrie for his wrong, nor make ſatisfaction, ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.58, 29. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.25, 26. but the Elderſhip could only admoniſh for a private offence, although they might caſt him out for a publike ſcandall, having the conſent of the Church, then Excommunication is not a humane Ordinance to be executed by the Civill Magiſtrate, then this doth directly ſuit with the Presbyteriall way of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who referre matters to the Elderſhip (as the Kingdom doth to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) and that Government in this point more agrees with the Word of God, then anie of the other.</p>
               <p>The next thing in the definition is, that they ought to be legally excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if a man go on in a way of error, ſo that he undermines the truth of Doctrine, or Diſcipline, or by prophanneſſe trample it under foot, then the Miniſter ought not of himſelfe to keep back ſuch a man from anie publike Ordinance of Chriſt; for if this power were in one mans breſt it were as bad as the Pope, or any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<pb facs="tcp:113457:3"/>in his Dioceſſe, it muſt be <hi>inflicted by many,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. then the people muſt not urge their Miniſter no do it, nor be offended with him if he do it not; for he hath no power to keep them back from anie Ordinance, nor to keep the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from them, <hi>for neceſſity is laid upon them, and wee be unto them if they preach not the Goſpell,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.16. and this neceſſity lies upon them to diſpence all the Ordinances of Chriſt to all in the Church, till they be legally caſt out.</p>
               <p>Now the legall way of Excommunication is this; Firſt, there muſt be a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conviction of the party that is to be caſt out, by witneſſes before the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, how this man by errour undermines the truth of the Goſpell, or by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe tramples it under foot, then the Elderſhip muſt admoniſh him to leave that wicked courſe of life: this it may be will make him at leaſt promiſe amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Reformation; then they muſt wait a while upon tryall, and it may be he may leave his errour, or prophane life, but if not, they muſt call him before them againe, and urge him of his promiſe, and tell him alſo, if he do not reforme, they muſt proceed to caſt him out; this it may be will make him promiſe more ſeriouſly to leave that ſinfull courſe, then they ought to forbeare, and try him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to ſhew themſelves loth to cut off a member, if it be poſſible to heale it.</p>
               <p>But if he have paſſed the firſt and ſecond admonition without Reformation, they muſt proceed againſt him, and conclude that he deſerves to be caſt out, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>A man that is an heretike alter the firſt and ſecond admonition, reject,</hi> Tit. 3.10. yet although they have paſſed their private cenſure among themſelves, that he deſerves to be caſt out, rather then the Ordinance of Chriſt ſhould be pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, as <hi>Paul</hi> did; and it is likely there was more with him when he ſaid, <hi>I have judged already though abſent, that he who hath done this deed may be taken from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.2, 3. yet he was not to be actually and ſolemnly caſt out, till <hi>they were gathered together in the Name of Chriſt, and with the power of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, Verſ.</hi> 4. and to keep the unitie of the Church, they muſt informe them how they have proceeded againſt this man by way of admonition, and ſtill hee goes on in his ſcandalous life, either undermining, or trampling the Ordinances of Chriſt under feet, and if the Church be willing they ſhall proceed to cenſure and caſt him out: but in caſe there be more in the Church againſt it then for it, then for the peace of the Church they muſt forbeare and try him againe by admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and if he go on ſtill, make it again known to the whole Church, and it may be they will conſent to have him caſt out; but if they will not, the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip muſt forbeare upon further tryall by admonition, leſt they make a breach in the Church, and ſo the remedie will be worſe then the diſeaſe. Thus uſing the meanes of admonition, no doubt in time the man will either be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, or the Church will give conſent to caſt him out, and the peace of it ſtill preſerved.</p>
               <p>The next thing in the Definition is, to ſhew who muſt be excommunicated.</p>
               <p>I anſwer: Only ſcandalous perſons, and they are of two ſorts; either ſuch as by the leaven of falſe doctrine undermine the truths of the Goſpell: Or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb facs="tcp:113457:3"/>ſuch as by the leaven of a prophane life trample the Goſpell under foot, both theſe muſt be kept out of the Chriſtian Church, or they will be the mine of it.</p>
               <p n="1">Firſt, if any man ſhall broach and maintaine any errour, or hereſie, againſt the truths of Chirſt, and by that meanes ſeek to deſtroy the doctrine, or diſcipline of the Chriſtian Religion, this is <hi>the leaven of the Phariſies and Sadduces, Matth.</hi> 16.10, 11. and ſo long as they hold ſuch errours, <hi>John</hi> would not admit them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chriſtian Church, becauſe like Vipers they would have eaten out the bewels of the Chriſtian Church: See <hi>Mat.</hi> 3 7. And for ſuch errors (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) they muſt becaſt out; for <hi>a little of this leaven will leaven the whole lump:</hi> therefore (ſaith he) <hi>I have confidence in you, in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that you will be none otherwiſe minded; but he that troubleth you ſhall have his judgement, whoſe ever he be, Galat.</hi> 5.9 10. If any cauſe griefe to the Church, <hi>ſufficient to ſuch a man is this puniſhment, which was inflicted of many.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6.</p>
               <p n="2">Secondly, this divine cenſure muſt be inflicted upon ſuch as have the leaven of a prophane life, elſe they will make the Lords people abhor the offerings of the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.17, 22, 24. And <hi>Paul</hi> hearing of the inceſtuous man, judgeth him worthy to be caſt out, and ſaith; <hi>Do not yee judge thoſe that are within, purge out therefore the old leaven, that you may be a new lump; and if that man will not repent, refraine his company; and if that will not reclaime him, caſt out from among your ſelves that wicked perſon,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. For as the leaven of errour will eat out both the truth of Doctrine and Diſcipline, like a canker, as did the words of <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineus</hi> and <hi>Phile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But ſome would have ignorance to be a ſufficient cauſe of caſting out, or at leaſt to keep them from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; but I can find no ſuch Text, for all came to the Paſſover without exception, unleſſe they were le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally uncleane, and ſo caſt out; and all thoſe young Converts came to the Lords Supper without any exception, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.46. and 20.7. If they were baptized, they were not debarred the other Sacrament; and they baptized multitudes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. and ſome of them knew not that there was any Holy Ghoſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they know Jeſus Chriſt, till <hi>Paul</hi> had taught them, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.1, 2, 3, 4. Yet here is no encouragement for ignorant perſons to ruſh upon the holy things of God, for they ſin fearfully, unleſſe they know God in his names and Attributes, his works of Creation, works of Grace and Providence, and Jeſus Chriſt as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour in his two Natures, and his Offices, and himſelfe in the ſtate of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and in the ſtate of corruption, and reſtored by Chriſt to grace here, and to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the ſoule after death, and in the body after the day of judgement; for, <hi>the ſinle without knowledge is not good, Prov.</hi> 19.2. See the danger of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.1. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1 8. <hi>not diſcerning the Lords body, they drink judgement:</hi> Mark. not the Miniſter, but to himſelfe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. Then if a faithfull Miniſter hath ſhewed them the danger, in coming without knowledge, and laboured to teach
<pb facs="tcp:113457:4"/>them, and ſtill they are willingly ignorant, he may ſay, <hi>Though Iſrael be not ga, thered, yet ſhall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, for my work is with my God Iſa.</hi> 49.4, 5. Here is <hi>a ſweet ſavour to Chriſt in them that are ſaved, and in them that periſh,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. This (I ſay) may comfort him, when they will neither learne knowledge, nor yet abſtaine from the Sacrament, and the Church hath no power to keep them back, nor caſt them out, unleſſe they oppoſe the Truth by prophaneneſſe or errour.</p>
               <p>The next thing in the Definition, is the extent of it, from what muſt they be excommunicated?</p>
               <p>I anſwer: From all the publike Ordinances of Chriſt in the Church, <hi>Miriam</hi> for ſedition againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſmitten with leproſie, and the Lord commanded to <hi>ſhut her out from the camp ſeven days, Num.</hi> 12.8.14. And <hi>Vzza</hi> for burning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, <hi>was ſmitten with leproſie, and dwelt in a ſeverall houſe till the day of his death, he was cut off from the houſe of the Lord</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.19 21. And ſaith <hi>Paul, Put away from among your ſelves that wicked perſon;</hi> and ſaith he, <hi>I would they were even cut off which trouble you, Gal.</hi> 5.12. By this it is plaine, that they were cut off from all publike Ordinances, which is contrarie to thoſe that would have them debarred from the Lords Supper only, and yet freely enjoy all other Ordinances, which is no excommunication at all, neither can any ſound reaſon be given, why they ſhould be kept from one ordinance, when as they may freely enjoy all the reſt.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing in the Definition is, the time how long they are to ſtand excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated? I anſwer: Till they be aſhamed, and by repentance and reformation give ſatisfaction to the Church, and then they may againe be re-admitted: the Lord ſaid, <hi>that ſhe may be aſhamed, ſhut her out of the camp ſeven dayes, and after that receive her in again, Numb.</hi> 12 14. And ſaith <hi>Paul, Have no company with him that he may be aſhamed,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.14. But although <hi>Miriam</hi> being a good woman, was aſhamed, and repented, yet <hi>Vzziah</hi> was cut off from the houſe of the Lord all the dayes of his life, becauſe hee repented not, to give the Church ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, they are caſt out of the Churches protection into Satans hands, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them with ſhame and ſorrow, uſing the verie Devill for the health of the the ſoule, as Phyſitians uſe poyſon for the health of the body; but when they (through griefe and ſorrow) are aſhamed, and repent, and promiſe reformation, they ought to be againe admitted, leſt Satan get advantage, and <hi>leſt they be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of overmuch ſorrow,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6.7.11. for their end muſt be, when they deliver them to Satan to be corrected, <hi>that their ſpirits may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. Neither doth excommunication cut off their right to the Ordinances altogether, only for the preſent their ſoules are deſperately ſick, and no eaſie phyſick will cure them: ſaith <hi>Paul, Himineus and Alexander I have delivered to Satan, that they may learne not to blaſpheme,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20 I ſuppoſe there was more with <hi>Paul,</hi> when hee did this, although they are not expreſſed; but they were not given into Satans to diſpoſe of them at his pleaſure; but as the Lord delivered <hi>Job</hi> into his hands to correct him, to humble him for his good, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:113457:4"/>doth the Church deliver them to Satan for ſhame and ſorrow, to make them leave blaſpheming, <hi>that their ſpirits may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> but they have not caſt them out of their prayers, admonitions, exhortations, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.14. And it was to keep the Ordinances from pollution, both for theirs and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches good; but then, if after all this, he ſhall upon ſelfe malice oppoſe Chriſt and the Goſpell, as <hi>Julian</hi> the Emperour did, and the Church diſcerne him to commit that unpardonable fin, they may declare this, and ſo leave him to his finall eſtate, and ceaſe to pray for him, being a ſin unto death, and not to be prayed for, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.16. and rather pray for juſtice upon him, than for any mercie to him, as <hi>Paul</hi> did for <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copper-ſmith, when he did him much evill, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. If they beare malicious <hi>hatred to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be anathema ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranatha,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.22. And if in malice to Chriſt, <hi>they teach any other Goſpell, let them be accurſed; yea, I ſay, let them be accurſed, Gal.</hi> 1.7.8, 9. <hi>If they bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheme againſt the Holy Ghoſt, they ſhall never be forgiven, becauſe they ſay he hath an uncleane ſpirit, Mark.</hi> 3.29, 30. <hi>Such as tread under foot the bloud of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, whereby they ſhould be ſanctified, and do deſpite unto the Spirit of Grace, Heb.</hi> 10.29. Such as theſe indeed the Church is to rid their hands of, and leave them to their finall eſtate; but ſuch a caſe as this wee heare of none but <hi>Julian</hi> ſince the Apoſtles dayes; but yet the Ordinance of Excommunication may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted in much mercie to the ſoule of him that is caſt out, and in love to the Ordinances of Chriſt, when they ſeek to keep them from pollution. And this was the cauſe why this Ordinance was given to the Church, to keep the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances from pollution by heretikes and prophane perſons, the Church having no humane power to defend it from pollution by the enemies of it in Doctrine and Diſcipline: But now whole Kingdomes have received the Chriſtian Faith, and Kings and Magiſtrates do aſſiſt it, and they make ſuch poſitive Lawes, as may ſuppreſſe both error and prophaneneſſe, and they are as a Guard about the Church, although they may not rule as Kings in it, yet they are to ſee their owne Lawes obſerved for the good of the Church, as nurſing fathers to it, and to puniſh the diſturbers of it, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.25, 26. And when Church-Officers declare to them, how errour eats out the Truth, and prophaneneſſe makes it to be deſpiſed, and the Magiſtrates will not puniſh it according to their poſitive Law, then the Church hath this power to caſt them out from the Ordinances of Chriſt, and not ſuffer them to be undermined by heretikes, nor trampled upon by prophane perſons.</p>
               <p>But in caſe the Magiſtrates be faithfull in their places, to puniſh errour and prophaneneſſe, when it is diſcovered and complained of, according to their poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Lawes; then the Church-Officers need not to excommunicate any for many yeares together; for this remedy was given to the Church when they had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humane Lawes nor Magiſtrates in it, to keep the Ordinances of Chriſt from pollution, and it is ſtill to be uſed, in caſe the Magiſtrates be negligent in their places: As the greater Presbyterie is in little uſe in the Church, it the leſſer El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip
<pb facs="tcp:113457:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>be well governed; but in caſe that be negligent, the greater Presbyt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 chunk">
                     <desc>…</desc>
                  </gap> hath the more trouble: For if Magiſtrates be faithfull, they will much eaſe them both. But in caſe they be nor, then (I ſay) God hath provided this help for the Church, to keep his Ordinances from pollution.</p>
               <p>Now that Church-Officers may be able to diſcover errour and prophaneneſſe, the Officers muſt all be proved before they be put into ani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> office, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.10. If Deacons muſt be ſo proved, much more ſhould ruling and teaching Elders, they muſt be knowne to have diſcerning eyes, to fore-ſee the firſt riſe of errour, and of a holy life, to contradict prophaneneſſe; when as the chiefe Magiſtrate comes to his place by inheritance, and ſometimes is a woman, a child, or weak in wits, if not prophane and careleſſe; and ſubordinate Magiſtrates ſometimes are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or careleſſe, and muſt have Lawyers to make knowne, who offend againſt the Lawes of the Land: So the Church had need to have thoſe that are well skilled in Gods Law, to make knowne who offends againſt it, and to judge of thoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and will labour to have them redreſſed, or their perſons puniſhed, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine Gods Law by errour, or hereſie, or that trample upon it by prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Now if prophane or erroneous perſons ſhall excommunicate themſelves from the publike Ordinances of Chriſt, either by negligence, or going a whoring after any Sects, or Schiſmes, and ſay their conſcience muſt be free to do ſo, then the Magiſtrate by his poſitive Lawes, muſt fetch them in, and command obedience to thoſe publike Ordinances in the Church, as the Kings of Judah did, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 17.6, 19, 10, 11, 31, 4, 35, 16. and if they <hi>will not obey the Law of God and the Law of the King, let judgement be ſpeedily executed upon them, either to death or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, confiſcation of goods, or impriſonment, Ezra</hi> 7.26. and for their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it may be as free as they will to the publike Ordinances of Chriſt, and the command of man cannot hinder it, unleſſe they deſpiſe obedience to God, for the very hatred they bear to the Magiſtrate for commanding it: but by this it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that they labour onlie to have their conſciences free to evill, for they may be free to as much good as they will, and none will hinder them.</p>
